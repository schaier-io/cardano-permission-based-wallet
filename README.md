We encurage discussions and ideas, however prioritize the modules stated in catalyst proposal first.

Since this is a very early stage, active contributions are not intended at this point. We will however open it up later on. Furthermore, if you encounter significant issues, bugs or have detected any potential security vulnurabilities, please feel free to open an issue or discuss them with the community or me directly on the Social Media channels (especially Discord).
